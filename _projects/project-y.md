# Steps Back

Description:
Steps Back is a top-down arcade game where the player has to evade the various enemies that go after him. It is ridiculously difficult because of the insane amount of enemy spawn points. Enemies will fire and chase your character down, and it's up to you to make sure he gets home safely! We don't know what awaits us at the end of the game, so let's find out.
